RARAG_QUERY_PROMPT = """You are a search expert. Transform the input query into either:
- multiple single-hop sub-queries (2-6 lines), or
- the original query unchanged (1 line),
following the rules below.

Query
{query}

Mechanism (what to do, then how to do it)

1) Decide whether to split (default: Always SPLIT)
- Always attempt to split the query into single-hop sub-queries.
- Split if the query requires >=2 distinct facts that are not co-located OR are for different entities and/or different timepoints/locations/contexts.
- Multi-hop questions (e.g., "Why did X's Y...", "What is A's B's C?") MUST be split into separate single-hop queries.
- Tie-breaker: when unsure, prefer SPLITTING.

2) Special cases for multi-hop splitting
- Multi-hop questions (e.g., "Why did the founder of Versus die?"):
  - Split into: "Who founded Versus?" + "Why did [founder] die?"
  - Each nested reference = one hop = one sub-query.
- Nested references (e.g., "director of film X", "spouse of the CEO"):
  - First sub-query: resolve the reference (e.g., "Who directed film X?")
  - Second sub-query: use the resolved entity for the next fact.
- List-style questions ("all/each/every ... and their ..."):
  - Split if the query explicitly names 2-6 specific entities/subjects.
  - Do not split if it would likely require more than 6 lines.

3) Split with minimal modification (use pronouns when possible)
- For multi-hop questions, split into: (1) the nested reference phrase, (2) the main question with minimal pronoun substitution.
- Replace the nested reference with a minimal pronoun/reference (e.g., "he", "she", "it", "they", "this person", "this place") in the second part.
- Keep the rest of the original question wording exactly as-is.
- Example: "Why did the founder of Versus die?" → "the founder of Versus" + "Why did he die?"
- Each sub-query will be used for similarity search as-is.

4) Preserve original wording with minimal substitution
- Keep the original question structure and wording as much as possible.
- Only replace the nested reference with a minimal pronoun/reference (e.g., "he", "she", "it", "they", "this person", "this place", "the company").
- Do NOT add extra words, explanations, or hints beyond the minimal pronoun substitution.
- Do NOT use placeholders like "[founder]" or "[resolved person]".

5) Handling common structures
- Conjunctions ("A and B"): one sub-query per entity/subject for the same attribute and constraints.
- Multi-entity multi-attribute: split by entity first in left-to-right order; within each entity, include only the minimal single-hop attribute per line needed to cover the orig
inal query (while respecting the 2-6 line cap).
- Relational questions ("A's relationship to B"):
  - Keep as one query if a single fact lookup answers it (e.g., "Who is A's spouse?").
  - Only add identity-resolution sub-queries if necessary to retrieve the relationship (see pronouns/ambiguity rule).
- Pronouns / ambiguous references:
  - If a pronoun exists AND its referent is not explicitly stated in the query, first add exactly one sub-query:
    Who does "[pronoun]" refer to in the context of "[minimal relevant context from the query]"?
  - Then add only the needed fact-lookup sub-queries.
  - If the referent is explicitly stated, do not add a resolution query.

6) Internal duplicate guardrail (must pass)
- Ensure no two lines ask for the same attribute of the same entity under the same timeframe/location/context.

Examples

Conjunction + timeframe (splittable, extract phrases)
Query: What were the populations of Canada and Mexico in 2021?
Output:
the population of Canada in 2021
the population of Mexico in 2021

"Between" question (extract facts only)
Query: How many days are there between Tom's birthday and Mike's birthday?
Output:
Tom's birthday
Mike's birthday

Relational (not splittable if single lookup)
Query: Who is Taylor Swift's boyfriend?
Output:
Who is Taylor Swift's boyfriend?

Pronoun resolution (splittable, extract phrase only)
Query: What country is he the president of in 2024?
Output:
Who does "he" refer to in the context of "the president of in 2024"?
What country is "he" the president of in 2024?

Multi-entity multi-attribute with constraints (splittable, extract phrases)
Query: What were Japan's GDP in 2023 and Germany's GDP in 2023?
Output:
Japan's GDP in 2023
Germany's GDP in 2023

Multi-hop (splittable, minimal pronoun substitution)
Query: Why did the founder of Versus die?
Output:
the founder of Versus
Why did he die?

Multi-hop with nested reference (splittable, minimal substitution)
Query: What is the birthplace of the director of film Beat Girl?
Output:
the director of film Beat Girl
What is the birthplace of he/she?

Multi-hop chain (splittable, minimal pronoun)
Query: What year was the wife of the governor of California born?
Output:
the wife of the governor of California
What year was she born?

List-style (do not split)
Query: List all members of the United Nations and their admission years.
Output:
List all members of the United Nations and their admission years?

Output Format (strict)
- Output ONLY the resulting queries.
- 1-6 lines total (if split: 2-6 lines; if not: 1 line).
- One query per line.
- Each line must be a full question ending with "?".
- No numbering, bullets, quotes, headings, or extra text.
- No blank lines.
- Final self-check before output:
  - Line count is valid (1-6; if split then 2-6).
  - Every line ends with "?".
  - No derived/operation wording appears in any sub-query.
  - No duplicate attribute/entity/timeframe queries.
